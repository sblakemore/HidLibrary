<h3>There has been quite a bit of interest in this little library over the years but unfortunately I'm not able to support it at this time. I'm also unable to answer questions about using it with different devices. So you're on your own if you decide to use it. Please feel free to fork it or send me a pull request if you would like to contribute.</h3>

Resources
------------

If your interested in HID development here are a few invaluable resources:  
  
1. [Jan Axelson's USB Hid Programming Page](http://janaxelson.com/hidpage.htm) - Excellent resource for USB Hid development. Full code samples in a number of different languages demonstrate how to use the Windows setup and Hid API.  
2. [Jan Axelson's book 'USB Complete'](http://janaxelson.com/usbc.htm) - Jan Axelson's guide to USB programming. Very good covereage of Hid. Must read for anyone new to Hid programming.
